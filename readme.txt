One of the earliest projects in my Bootcamp was to build a three-page site using a Bootstrap framework. As projects are completed during the 24-week course, my portfolio page will be updated with new links. 

-----WHAT I DID-----
For this project, I focused on building out a layout that works well on a desktop and also on a phone. Using Bootstrap allowed me to easily adjust content areas for various formats. As part of the responsive design I was able to shrink the navigation bar to a "hamburger" format. 

-----WHAT I LEARNED-----
The biggest takeaways I had from this project were the value of using a framework when considering a clean layout and responsive design. I also learned the importance of pseudo-coding and preplanning for the use of a grid system. It is very easy to get lost in the rows and divs if you haven't fully thought through your content and layout. 


-----WHAT'S NEXT-----
Future plans include an update to the form and make the submit button functional to send notifications to me. I'll also take some time to refactor this small site.
